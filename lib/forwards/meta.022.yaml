title: ForwardMap
description: |
  Sometimes a project is complex enough to split up into multiple directories. In this case, you may have `ops.yml` files in several places, but still want to provide easy access to these actions from the top-level directory.

  With this config, `ops app test` will have the same effect as running `ops test` from the `app` directory. `ops inf deploy` will be the same as `cd infrastructure && ops deploy`.

  When a command is forwarded to another directory, no config, secrets, or environment variables are set based on the current directory's `ops.yml`, and no hooks are run from the current directory's `ops.yml`.

  If you want access to the top-level directory's config or secrets from the subdirectory, link it in the subdirectory's `ops.yml`.
