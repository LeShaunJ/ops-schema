description: Sometimes, a command implementation may call for variable interpetation. This is semi-achieved with `shell_expansion` by default; however, unless the command is a pass-through to a script, there's no way to interpret parameters as postional variables. Enter `param_expansion`. Setting this to `true` instructs `ops` to bind any aguements passed during execution to positional variables within the `command` script.
