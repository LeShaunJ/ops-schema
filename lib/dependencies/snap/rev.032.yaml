  - Specifies that a particular package from `snap` is needed.
  - Unlike `apt`, `brew`, or `apk`, `snap` may be present on any Linux system, and its presence alone probably shouldn't be taken as a sign that ops should install every `snap` listed in dependencies.
  - Therefore, ops will never install `snaps` unless `options.snap.install` is true.
