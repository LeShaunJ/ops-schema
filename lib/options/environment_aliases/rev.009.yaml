title: EnvironmentAliasList
description: |
  Different software systems use different environment variables to determine the software execution environment. E.g. Ruby on Rails uses `RAILS_ENV`. Thus, `ops` allows the user to specify which variables should also be set to the name of the software environment.

  If any `environment_aliases` are specified in `ops.yml`, `ops` will not change the value of `$environment` unless it is listed as well.

  (`ops` will always use `$environment` to detect the software execution environment; `environment_aliases` just makes `ops` set other variables to match it.)
