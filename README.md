# Ops Schema

An unofficial tracking and collection of schema revisions for the `ops.yaml` configuration file used in [`ops`](https://github.com/nickthecook/ops)—and more recently—[`crops`](https://github.com/nickthecook/crops).

Available via the [schemastore.org](https://www.schemastore.org/json/) API.

## Editor Support

Hardly exhaustive; though, any editor with `YAML` schema support can benefit from this.

### VScode (Visual Studio Code)

`vscode` can be had via the [YAML Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension from [Red Hat](https://redhat.com/). Simply install and enjoy immediate recognition and binding of all `ops.yaml`/`ops.yaml` files in your projects.

## Contributing

Of course contributions are welcome. See the [guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
