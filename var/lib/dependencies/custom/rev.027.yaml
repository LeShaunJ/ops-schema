  - Runs the given command.
  - Can't tell if the command needs to be run or not, so always runs it on `ops up`.
  - Therefore, the command should be idempotent.
  - It's also a good idea to prevent it from printing output unless it encounters an error, to keep the ops output clean.
  - If a `custom` dependency is given as a hash, you can define separate `up` and `down` actions that are run when `ops up` or `ops down` are called, respectively.
markdownDescription: |
  * Runs the given command.
  * Can't tell if the command needs to be run or not, so always runs it on `ops up`.
  * Therefore, the command should be [**idempotent**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).
  * It's also a good idea to prevent it from printing output unless it encounters an error, to keep the ops output clean.
  
  #### `custom` dependencies with `up` and `down`

  If a `custom` dependency is given as a hash, you can define separate `up` and `down` actions that are run when `ops up` or `ops down` are called, respectively.

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
  	custom:
  		- init file:
  				up: touch file
  				down: rm file
  ```

  You can also define only the `down` command, which will execute on `ops down`; nothing will be executed by the dependency on `ops up`.

  > **NOTE:** The lines with `up` and `down` are indented past the beginning of the text `init file`. YAML considers `- ` in a list to be part of the indentation, and `up` and `down` must be _children_ of the name of the custom depdenceny, not siblings. Therefore, the following is **incorrect**:
  >
  > ```yaml
  > dependencies:
  > 	custom:
  > 		- init file:
  > 			up: touch file
  > 			down: rm file
  > ```
  >
  > as it results in a Hash like:
  > 
  > ```ruby
  > {
  > 	"init file" => nil,
  > 	"up" => "touch file",
  > 	"down" => "touch file"
  > }
  > ```
