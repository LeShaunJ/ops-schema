  This dependency will create an SSH key pair with key size 4096 and key algorithm `rsa` at `keys/$environment/user@host` and `keys/$environment/user@host.pub`. It will also add it to your SSH agent, if `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set, with a lifetime of 3600 seconds (one hour).

  The key comment, which is visible in the output of `ssh-add -l`, will be set to the name of the directory that contains `ops.yml`. For example, if the directory is named `heliograf`, you would see the following output:

  2048 SHA256:Z6oEPBIoBrHv/acYiBGBRYLe2sEONV17tDor3h5eNtc certitude (RSA)
  ```

  This output shows that one key from a project called `heliograf` and one key from a project called `certitude` have been loaded.
