  Sometimes you want to run a command before other commands. Some examples:

  - You have a number of ops commands that let a developer run different test suites inside a container, and you want to make sure the container image is built beforehand.
  - You have some configuration that needs to happen when the software execution environment changes (e.g. going from dev to staging).

  In this case, you can use the "hooks feature.
