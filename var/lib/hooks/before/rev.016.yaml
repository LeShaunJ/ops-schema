title: BeforeHooks
description: |
  A series of hooks that run before actions. They do not run before builtins like `up` or `exec`.

  `before` hooks are always executed before secrets are loaded. If you would like a before hook to have access to secrets, create an action with `load_secrets: true` and call the action from a before hook.
